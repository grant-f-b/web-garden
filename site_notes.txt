==> INSPIRATION:
=> speciific sites that have inspired me to create this site

https://moth.monster/blog/html-tutorial/ -- html tutorial for making a simple html site; this site definitely would not exist if not for this blog post 

https://blog.cassidoo.co/ -- tech blog that is gorgeous on desktop and mobile; I especially love the changing color scheme and tag system for posts
https://sunny.gg/ -- another tech blog that dubs itself as a simpleton website and has plain text posts like this page(or had one at one point anyways but that post seems to have been take down); the format and style of the tables on my pages are based on the tables here 
https://t0.vc -- an extremely simple html blog with a neat guest book
https://rachsmith.com -- I love the way this blog lists their posts by month and how the dates are colorful

https://nalinplad.github.io/small_web_things/ -- html widget templates; don't have a use for any of them yet but these are good examples of little things I'd like to tinker with on these pages in the future 

+-----------------------+

==> HTML TOOLS:	
=> docs for tools that are used to build this site 

https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/ -- css code documentation; currently using this to refresh css of my site which I discovered sunny.gg using;  

https://md-block.verou.me/#usageHow --	md-block documentation; used with first version of my site but not currently in use here, possibly in the future
