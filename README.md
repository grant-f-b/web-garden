# web-garden

this is my own digital garden that i can tend to and keep building onto 

my first goal is organizing a journal/blog section for posting my thoughts and notes mostly probably about this site and how i have created it

second, i intend to create a spot to host my college football rating system and then hopefully eventually add more projects maybe like a hub of lists or a web-comic page
