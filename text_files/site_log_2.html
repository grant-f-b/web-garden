~✎~✎~ SITE LOG #2 ~✎~✎~ 

It is well past due for another write-up about the changes I've made to my site. I went on a bit of an update craze back in February after neglecting the site since like early fall. The first updates I made of course came to my rating system. The season ended with Notre Dame taking the rare PBQR title despite not winning the playoff. I actually don't know how often that happens, it might not be that rare. I added some all-time ratings to show who has done the best over the last 10 years combined and a few things like that. Now that it's a whole decade in the bag and things are changing a lot around here soon, both in my life and in the college football world, maybe I will change it up or even take a break next season. Hopefully I take it to the next level like I have always written about. 

Next, as you can see on this page, I have updated my writing files to look more like the rest of my site instead of just leaving them plain text. Now that I think of it, I will probably add a "toggle" of some sort even though it would be a one-way ticket kinda thing, that would let you turn the page back into the plain text version. But it would not be able to link back to the html version of course so it's not like you can toggle back and forth so it's more of just a button. I also changed the links to purple all over my site. That was part of a site-wide effort to adopt a dedicated color scheme of my own design. I first of all had to adjust even the base colors when I realized I had designed my site with a heavy blue-light filter on my laptop. After turning that off and changing my site to the real color I wanted it to be, I chose purple for links and orange for highlights. I did just notice there's quite a few links left that are other colors still. Links to pages are all black, the link to all-time and yearly ratings on the main PBQR page are blue, and the link to the data source for the ratings are green. I should probably change every last one of them to purple to make my whole site nice and aligned. I do still like that blue color and I have a blue in my expanded color scheme I like to use for other things like my notes. So I may incorporate that blue eventually. After all, if you ask Sonia she would tell you how often I use purple-green-orange as my default color scheme. I was heavily influenced by Buzz Lightyear and Nickelodeon growing up. I just realized the blue still plays into Buzz Lightyear, not that I was expecting the blue to make the site color scheme any less toy-like. It would just be a nice stray away from the usual main three that I tend to spam anywhere I can. 

I made some other general improvements like aligning the font across the whole site to be monospace everywhere. Then I updated the titles for all the main pages of my site and the little snippet on my home page. I also aligned most of the page titles that are displayed in the browser tabs to make them more cohesive and they were just a mess. 

The next update is my most controversial update. I added a music files page to house playable recordings of songs I made with my friends. I was able to build most of the page, but I did use Copilot (or Gemini, I honestly don't remember) to help me build the actual music player part of the page, with the time-scrubber and playback buttons. I also used it to whip up the color palette display at the bottom of my site notes page while I was experimenting with it. Then I made the little site tree near the bottom of the home page, so AI did end up contirbuting to a lot of pieces of this update. I have a million thoughts on AI, but I probably won't go into much detail on my site. It was fun, I probably won't use it again for a while, though. I end up not having much to write about in updates like these, like with the site tree. I punched in a prompt and tweaked a few things, big whoop. I can't recall how any of it works back to anybody after doing it and it doesn't end up being any kind of interesting experience I suppose. Even though I created this site entirely after the advent of the whole LLM craze, that was just never how I intended to build this thing. I have officially gotten the site in a place where my writing workflow is nice and easy and I can kinda blog however much I please. I do just need to stop dropping out of the routine of it all. Can't keep refining the workflow without touching my site for three or four months at a time. Can't have errors without trials. □
